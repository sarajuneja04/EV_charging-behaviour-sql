 Global EV Charging Behavior 2024 – SQL Data Analysis Project

This project explores real-world electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior data using SQL. The dataset includes detailed information such as country, city, EV models, manufacturers, charging station types, charging duration, energy delivered, and payment methods. The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns, optimizing insights, and understanding EV charging infrastructure globally.
